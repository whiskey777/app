# app
## Working somehow
back + database connected

back on start checking if DB available, then trying to init if empty

basic test API created.

## to do

superuser creation on empty DB (not even sure if I need that, everything will go through API in future, but could be useful for tests)

update DB on start (and on schedule? cron? can jango do it for me?)
- parsing XML file 
- upload data in postgres DB

create API 
- GET all object
- GET objects filtered by date frame
